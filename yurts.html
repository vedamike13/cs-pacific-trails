        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails </h2>

        <h3>What is a Yurts?</h3>

        <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
            <br> Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that
            <br> can be opened.</p>

        <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>

        <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
            <br> gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes
            <br> electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
            <br> restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>


        <h3>What should I bring?</h3>

        <p>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also
            <br> pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
            <br> weather with layers of clothing.</p>
