     <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails </h2>
    
     <h3>What is a Yurts?</h3>
    
     <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. <br>
        Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that <br>
        can be opened.</p>
    
     <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
    
     <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and <br>
        gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes <br>
        electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and <br>
        restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
    
    
    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
    
     <p>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also <br>
        pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing <br>
        weather with layers of clothing.</p>
